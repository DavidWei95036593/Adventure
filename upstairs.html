 After you go up all the stairs in the second floor, the stairs suddenly all fall out. There is no way back now. When you turn yourself back, you reliazed there's a showdow at the end of the hallway. You'll shocked and nearly scream for help, until you then reliaze that the shawdow is only yourself. After a few tries on each door of the hallway, you've found that all the doors are either locked or heavliy damage. However, only two doors were be able to open. A one with a spooky smiley face painted in bloodly red, and another one with nothing painted on it. </big></b></font>
